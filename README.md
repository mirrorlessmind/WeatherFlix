# Weather Flix App

## Description

WeatherFlix is an in-broswer app that presents the user with movie suggestions. The user will provide input for their mood and their current location. The application will then suggest movies for the user to choose from.

## Development

The WeatherFlix app was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. JQuery and Bulma were used to enhance functionality and appearance. 

Third-party APIs were used for data on weather and movies. The weather, based on location, comes from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API. Data about movies (including the title, plot, year produced, and a poster image) use the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) API.
